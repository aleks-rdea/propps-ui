# Theme

Takes a 'name' prop that defines the global style/theme for the page, including key colors, fonts and logo. The goal is to avoid changes that would sacrifice accessibility or the experience in any way, while still giving branded pages a unique, ownable feel.

I'm thinking the name could be dynamically populated from a store/redux, and changed to an agent theme when on an agent-branded listing.
